/*
 * Packing changes how the compiler aligns struct members in memory. Normally, the compiler adds padding bytes so each member is aligned for fast CPU access. When packing is applied (e.g., #pragma pack(1)), padding is reduced or removed, so members are stored tightly together. This makes the struct smaller in size, but access may be slower because members may not be aligned to the CPUâ€™s preferred boundaries.*/
