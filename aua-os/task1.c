/*
 Variables of different types in memory are aligned according to their size and CPU requirements. The compiler may insert padding bytes so that each variable starts at an address that is a multiple of its typeâ€™s alignment (e.g., int on 4-byte boundaries, double on 8-byte boundaries). This ensures faster access by the CPU, but it can make the total size of a struct larger than the sum of its members. Smaller types like char may be placed with padding before or after them to maintain alignment.* */
